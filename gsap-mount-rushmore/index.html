<p>Scrollpoints on a 3d model. Wait for the model to load, then do scrolly. Simple lerp of the
    camera; better solution would be to incorporate rotation on the camera so we have better
    maneouvering. Also needs slerp and easing.

    <p id="thomas-jefferson">Thomas Jefferson (April 13, 1743[a] – July 4, 1826) was an American statesman, diplomat,
        lawyer, architect, philosopher, and Founding Father who served as the third president of the

        and form a new nation; he produced formative documents and decisions at both the state and
        national levels.
