<p class="paragraph para-0 svelte-1fqq930"><span class="counter svelte-1fqq930">0.0</span> Look... I feel like I&#39;m running out of ways to explain this to you but once
        more, I shall try. This fly is a major problem for us. It will ruin our batch.
        And we need to destroy it and every trace of it, so we can cook. Failing
        that, we&#39;re dead. There&#39;s no more room for error. Not with these people.
        You asked me if we were in the meth business or the money business. Neither,
        I’m in the empire business. I was under the impression that you had this
        under control. Well, that&#39;s what this is - problem solving. Skyler this is a
        simple division of labor - I bring in the money, you launder the money. This is
        what you wanted.
        Who are you talking to right now? Who is it you think you see? Do you know how
        much I make a year? I mean, even if I told you, you wouldn&#39;t believe it. Do you
        know what would happen if I suddenly decided to stop going into work?

        A business big enough that it could be listed on the NASDAQ goes belly up.
        Disappears! It ceases to exist without me. No, you clearly don&#39;t know who
        you&#39;re talking to, so let me clue you in. I am not in danger, Skyler. I AM the
        danger! A guy opens his door and gets shot and you think that of me? No. I am
        the one who knocks!

        Did he speak to you? Would you just answer? What things? What people? A month
        ago, Gus was trying to kill both of us. And now, he pulls you out of the lab
        and employs you as... what... a, an assistant gunman? A tough guy? Does that
        make any sense to you? He says he sees something in you. What kind of game is
        he playing. Does he think you&#39;re that naïve? He can&#39;t truly think that you&#39;d
        forget... let alone Gale, let alone Victor... and all the horror that goes
        along with all of that.

        It&#39;s enough. This is still the best way. You go after him with a gun, you&#39;ll
        never get out of it alive. But with this... you slip it into his food or drink,
        there shouldn&#39;t be any taste or smell... thirty-six hours later... poof. A
        man his age, working as hard as he does... no one will be surprised. Mike can
        have his suspicions, but that&#39;s all they&#39;ll be. Please, one homicidal maniac at
        a time.

        Look, I&#39;ll give you Jesse Pinkman, OK? Like you said, he&#39;s the problem, he&#39;s
        always been the problem and without him, we would... and he&#39;s in town, alright?
        He&#39;s not in Virginia or wherever the hell you&#39;re looking for him. He&#39;s
        right here in Albuquerque and I can take you to him, I&#39;ll take you right to
        him. What do you say?

        It&#39;s complicated and I don&#39;t wish to discuss it. It&#39;s none of your concern. You
        know what, let&#39;s just say that I have a hell of a lot more on my mind, right
        now, than thinking about buying a damn car wash. Okay? So if you could just...
        please.

        Stop. Stop! You keep saying that word - danger... danger! No and I have never
        used that word. I said things were complicated. And then you flew off the
        handle!

        Gus is gonna make his move. I don&#39;t know when, I don&#39;t know where or how. All I
        know is it&#39;s gonna happen. Powerless to stop him.

        I have been waiting. I&#39;ve been waiting all day. Waiting for Gus to send one of
        his men to kill me. And it&#39;s you. Who do you know, who&#39;s okay with using
        children, Jesse? Who do you know... who&#39;s allowed children to be murdered...
        hmm? Gus! He has, he has been ten steps ahead of me at every turn. And now,
        the one thing that he needed to finally get rid of me is your consent and
        boy he&#39;s got that now. He&#39;s got it. And not only does he have that, but he
        manipulated you into pulling the trigger for him.

        No! You don&#39;t even believe that! Gus has cameras everywhere, please. Listen to
        yourself! No, he has known everything, all along. Where were you today? In the
        lab? And you don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible that Tyrus lifted the cigarette out of
        your locker? Come on! Don&#39;t you see? You are the last piece of the puzzle. You
        are everything that he&#39;s wanted.

        You&#39;re his cook now. You&#39;re the cook and you have proven that you can run a lab
        without me and now that cook has reason to kill me. Think about it! It&#39;s
        brilliant. So go ahead. If you think that I am capable of doing this, then go
        ahead. Put a bullet, in my head, and kill me right now. DO IT! Do it. Do it. Do
        it.

        Saul, Saul... this man that we spoke of before, this... this person that you
        said could... could disappear me, get me a whole new life and make sure that
        I&#39;m never found. Yeah I need him, Saul. Gus is gonna murder my whole family. I
        need this man now. Saul... now, Saul!

        Anything suspicious? Well... then should we go? Any uh... Cartel news these
        days? Seems like I&#39;m always reading something or other in the paper. I don&#39;t
        want to talk about it. To you or anyone else. I&#39;m done explaining myself. Gus
        is dead. We&#39;ve got work to do.

        Jesse Jackson? Do you even... ah, I see you have a telephone at least. You know
        that blinking thing I&#39;ve been calling you on? I will break this, I will BREAK
        THIS. Damn druggie idiot. Is this what you&#39;ve been doing the whole time I&#39;ve
        been trying to reach you?

        The game has changed. The word is out. And you... are a killer. Apparently it&#39;s
        all over town. Somebody crossed you, you got angry, you crushed their skull
        with an ATM machine. Who cares! Just as long as it&#39;s our competitors who
        believe it and not the police.

        He&#39;ll live. I asked to see you in order to... clear the air. There are uh,
        some... issues that could cause a misunderstanding between us and I think
        it&#39;s in our best interest to lay the cards on the table. My brother-in-law,
        moments before he was attacked, someone called to warn him. I believe that
        same person was protecting me.

        Those two men, the assassins. I believe I was their prime target, but that
        somehow they were steered away from me to my brother-in-law. Because of this
        &#39;intervention&#39; I am alive. And yet, I think that this person was playing a much
        deeper game. He made that phone call because he wanted a shootout not a silent
        assassination.
